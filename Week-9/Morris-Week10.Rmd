**Introduction**
The New York Times web site provides a rich set of APIs, as described here: http://developer.nytimes.com/docs Youâ€™ll need to start by signing up for an API key.

Your task is to choose one of the New York Times APIs, construct an interface in R to read in the JSON data, and transform it to an R dataframe.

Search the top stories list of articles and associated images by the sections

```{r}
# Load library
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}

articleUrl <- "http://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q=%s&sort=newest&api-key=82badbe8a6564c9cbf9c12f877fdffc9"

out <- fromJSON(articleUrl)
out

```



```{r}
# Display column names in data frame
outDf <- data.frame(out[[1]]$docs)
variable.names(outDf)
```

```{r}
length(outDf)
```

```{r}
# Select subset of columns in data frame
outSub <- select(outDf, snippet, lead_paragraph, headline, pub_date, section_name)

# Identify the widest column
outWidth <- max(sapply(names(outSub), nchar))
format(outSub, width = outWidth, justify = "left")

```
